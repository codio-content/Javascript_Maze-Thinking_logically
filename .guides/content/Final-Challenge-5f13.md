## Solution

The ordering of the various "Add" functions is not essential, as long as they come after `createEmptyMaze`. The solution will need to include enough energy stores to increase the score to meet the requirement when the goal is reached.

```javascript
createEmptyMaze()
addWall()
addWall()
addWall()
addWall()
addEnergy()
addEnergy()
addEnergy()
addEnergy()
addEnergy()
addEnergy()
addEnergy()
addEnergy()
addEnergy()
addEnergy()
addPlayer()
addGoal()
```
