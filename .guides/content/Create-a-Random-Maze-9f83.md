On the left hand side is a game with nothing in it whatsoever. You are soon going to add things into the game. 

To start off with, we are going to use command blocks to represent the instructions. You can drag commands from the left hand toolbox into the white area on its right. 

Start off by dragging in the command 'Create Random Maze'.

What you have done here is to execute a single instruction that creates a maze with a random number of walls, monsters and energy stores.

Press the Reload button again and you will see you get a different maze each time.
