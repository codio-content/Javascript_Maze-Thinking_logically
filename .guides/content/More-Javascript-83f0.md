Now we're going to see how to achieve exactly the same thing with Javascript.

Take a look at the code on the left. Here, we've put in 3 lines to start you off.

```javascript
createEmptyMaze()
addWall()
addMonster(6,8)
```

## Arguments
We're not talking about having a verbal battle here. The 6 and the 8 in the brackets are called **arguments**.

If we specified `addMonster()` without any arguments (which we did before), then you can see that a monster gets added, but at a completely random location.

If we **do** specify arguments, then we get a monster at the position we specify.

The first argument `6` is the X coordinate and the second argument `8` is the Y coordinate. 

## Change it
Go ahead and change the following and see what happens.

- add 2 coordinate arguments to the `addWall()` function call.
- remove the coordinates from the `addMonster()` function call.
- Feel free to add more lines
