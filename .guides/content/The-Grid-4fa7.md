Now, rather than randomly positioning things, we are going to give you the control and ability to decide what elements go where.

## Grid System
The first thing we should explain is how the grid system of our game works. Look at the image below. You can see that the game is really made up of a grid or matrix of square tiles.

Each of these tiles has an X and Y coordinate pair. The left most column is column 1, the next one column 2 etc. The column value is referred to by the X coordinate.

The top row of the grid is row 1, the next row is row 2 etc. The row value is referred to by the Y coordinate.

In the image you can see 2 tiles which have the coordinates

- X=3 and Y=8 which we can shorten to (3,8)
- X=7 and Y=4, which we can shorter to (7,4)

We'll now use this system to place our elements exactly where we want them to be.
