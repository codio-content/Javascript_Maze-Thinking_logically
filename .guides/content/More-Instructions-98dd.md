Now let's add more commands so youhave more control over the game.

In the toolbox on the left, you can see we have a bigger set of commands.

You can see that some of the commands have holes in them. Don't worry about these holes for now.

- **Add Player** adds the player
- **Add Wall** adds a wall section into the maze at a random location
- **Add Monster** adds a monster
- **Add Energy** adds an energy store

Play around with these commands, making sure you start off with a 'Create Empty Maze' instruction.
