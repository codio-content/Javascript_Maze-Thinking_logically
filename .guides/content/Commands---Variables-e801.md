- The objective is to move your player from its starting point to the exit.
- Use the arrow keys to move the player around.
- You can collect energy by moving into the energy object.
- There are also monsters. You can kill a monster by moving into it. If you do this, you get bonus energy points.
- If a monster moves into you, then you lose energy.
- When your energy level is 0, you die!!!
- You should try to collect as much energy as you can to make sure you reach the exit before you run out.
